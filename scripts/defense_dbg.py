"""The level 6 attack decision's debug block (Nick, 2026-09-27: one RAM dump must show why the CPU does or doesn't
attack). A fixed 64-byte block in the data section, WRITTEN by cpu_item_defense.py's stubs every frame they run for
the chaser, READ by the defense log (cpu_defense_log.py) once per frame. Always allocated (64 bytes) when
cpu_item_defense is in the build; nothing reads it unless the log is on.

Layout (big-endian; offsets are the constants below). The writer writes FRAME first each frame it runs; a reader
treats the block as this frame's only when FRAME == the frame it logs (else the stub didn't run: gated upstream).
  FRAME   s16  frames since contact (*(r13-0x1684)+2) when the stubs last ran for the chaser. Written first by the
               header stub at 0x800E28CC (the top of FUN_800E2830, before its gates: runs every frame 800E21EC calls
               800E2830, i.e. ball loose, not held, a chaser, no pass target) and again by the decision stub. FRAME
               stale = 800E2830 didn't run that frame (ball held / not loose / no chaser / pass target).
               Frame order [C]: 800E246C (dive press, cpu_dive.py) runs BEFORE 800E2830 in 800E21EC, so a reader in
               800E246C sees the previous frame's block; the 8011F748 hook and ROUTE (800D5A38's fielder updates) run
               after it and see this frame's.
  CHASER  s8   the chaser's fielder index (0..8), -1 none
  REASON  u8   why no attack / what it did this frame (REASONS below). The header writes the gate reasons 2-5 / 13
               (and 16 on the POW jump); past the gates the decision stub overwrites it.
  PHASE   u8   the attack sequence (PHASES below). 1-3 = the attack is planned for CHASER this frame (he goes to the
               spot, no catch / run-catch / dive commit), 4 = pressed this frame or already in the action (+0x265).
  PRESS   u8   1 = the attack press (ai+0xD4 = 1) was written this frame
  T       s8   the first path frame (from now) the game's hit test FUN_8011F2B0 would connect from his spot, -1 none
  MATE_ID s8   the nearest teammate's index, -1 none
  MATE_D  f32  the nearest teammate's distance
  SPOT_X / SPOT_Z f32  the attack spot the route sends him to
  SPOT_D  f32  his distance to the attack spot
  BEST_D  f32  the closest ground distance the predicted ball comes to his current spot in the scan window
  BEST_Y  f32  the ball height at that frame
  REACH   f32  his hit reach (F+0x1C + ball radius game+0x420)
  FACE    f32  the angle between his facing and the direction to the ball (radians), when set
  AUX0    s32  the frames he needs to the attack spot, (int)(SPOT_D / F+0xEC) (0 when there; -1 not computed)
  AUX1    u32  cpu_dive.py's stub (runs BEFORE the decision stub each frame): (frame << 16) | flags, written only when
               a level 6 CPU dive press came; bit 0 = dive suppressed for the attack. The decision stub must not
               clear it.
  T_SPOT  s8   the first path frame the hit test connects from the attack spot (the plan's test), -1 none
  FLAGS   u8   bit 0: 8011F748's catch / run-catch / dive block skipped for the plan (hook 0x8011FCD4); bit 1: a
               committed catch cancelled for the plan (ROUTE); bit 2: his facing written toward the ball (TURN); bit 3: the ball comes through his reach where he stands: S = here (Nick: no move).
               Cleared by the header each frame.
  M_FRAME s16  the path frame of the landing / pickup point B the spot is built from (-1 none)
  JUMP    u8   the fly-ball peak jump this frame (the normal play; JUMPS below), 0 = not evaluated. Cleared by the header.
  JUMP_D  f32  his predicted distance to the ball at the jump's peak frame (the reach test), when evaluated
